It provides the density, distribution function, quantile function, random number generator, reliability function, failure rate, likelihood function, moments and EM algorithm for Maximum Likelihood estimators, also empirical quantile and generated envelope for a given sample, all this for the three parameter Birnbaum-Saunders model based on Skew-Normal Distribution. Additionally, it provides the random number generator for the mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders model based on Skew-Normal distribution.
